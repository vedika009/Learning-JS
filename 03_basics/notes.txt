JavaScript Execution Context----------------------

Code -->  Global Execution Context ('this' keyword)

'this' keyword's value in browser = Window object

1. Global Execution Context 
2. Function Execution Context
- Eval Execution Context

1. Memory Creation Phase (or Creation Phase)
2. Execution Phase

FLOW OF STEPS FOR A JS PROGRAM:
1. Global Execution (this)

2. Memory Creation Phase
    val1 -> umdefined
    val2 -> undefined
    addnum -> definition
    result1 -> undefined
    result2 -> undefined

3. Execution Phase     
    val1 <- 10
    val2 <- 5
    addnum -->  [New Execution Context]
                            |
                [ New Varibale Environment + Execution Thread ]
                1. Memory Creation Phase (or Creation Phase)
                    val1 -> undefined
                    val2 -> undefined
                    total -> undefined

                2. Execution Phase
                    num1 <- 10
                    num2 <- 5
                    total <- 15  --will return to Global Execution Context

                - Gets Deleted   
    result1 <- 15

    addnum -->  [New Execution Context]
                            |
                [ New Varibale Environment + Execution Thread ]
                1. Memory Creation Phase (or Creation Phase)
                    val1 -> undefined
                    val2 -> undefined
                    total -> undefined

                2. Execution Phase
                    num1 <- 10
                    num2 <- 2
                    total <- 12  --will return to Global Execution Context

                - Gets Deleted   
    result2 <- 12
